Hi, I'm Devin Collins. I'm a software developer who enjoys automating processes, learning new things, and just in general finding ways to make things for easier for myself, my friends, my family, and anyone I can really.

In the past, I've tried to make consistent blog posts but fell out of it pretty quickly. So instead of trying that, and feeling bad when I can't, this is more of a place for me to keep thoughts and ideas about things I've been up. That could range from being a parent, working on open source applications, or just random musings of things I'm trying to learn.

The best way to reach me at the moment are either [email](mailto:me@imdevinc.com) or [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/imdevinc.com).
